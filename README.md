# Project 4: Mental Health Awareness
**External User’s Goal:** The user seeks accessible, beginner-friendly information on mental health, including how to recognize common issues and manage stress, presented in a supportive and organised layout.

**Site Owner’s Goal:** The site owner wants to create a welcoming webpage that provides basic mental health information using a clean and supportive design. The focus is on using HTML and CSS with Bootstrap to create a calming and well-organised user experience.

## Potential Features might Include:
- Hero Section with Positive Messaging: A Bootstrap Jumbotron with an encouraging message about mental health, using a calming colour scheme and a simple background image.
- Information Cards: Use Bootstrap’s card components to present mental health tips and common issues, providing a visually appealing way to organise content.
- Resource Links: A grid layout for external links to mental health resources styled with Bootstrap buttons to make them stand out.
- Positive Affirmations: Use Bootstrap’s text utilities to include a section with uplifting quotes or messages to encourage users.
